STRATEGY 

To create a website thatâ€™s easy to search for a holiday destination and hopefully find a suitable location for short,long or that well desreved weekend break.Tab options for car hire,hotels and insurance.

STRUCTURE 

At this stage we will start to bring together the ideas found in the STARTEGY section.The navbar comprises of a single dropdown tab for additional searches.Hotels,insurance and vehicle hire options.Website should be responsive for mobile first,tablet and desktop
working.All div containers are on one page. 


SURFACE 

I have chosen the Bootstrap framework to build the site as it provides essential tools to make our website look
and feel presentable and easy on the eye. All images have their borders trimmed to give them a smooth effect.
