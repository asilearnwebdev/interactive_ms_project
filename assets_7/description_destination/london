 
<p>Nothing prepares you for your first taste of London.</p>
<p> This great world city is far more than just the capital of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p> London is bustling, vibrant, multicultural and cosmopolitan.</p>
<p> London is both old and new, a place where traditional pubs rub shoulders with the newest cocktail bars.</p>
<p> Its most ancient castle is right next door to its newest skyscrapers.</p>
<p> London's energy, as 8.6 million people go about their everyday lives,is tangible in every journey on the Underground and every walk along the banks of the River Thames.</p>
<p> From the palaces of shopping to the real Buckingham Palace, London really does have it all.</p>
